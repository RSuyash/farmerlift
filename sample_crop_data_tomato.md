## 1. Cultivation Stages (ACF Fixed Slots)

### Stage 1: Nursery Preparation & Sowing
*   **Stage Name**: `Nursery & Sowing (0-25 Days)`
*   **Description**:
    *   **Goal**: Healthy, disease-free seedlings.
    *   **Action**: Use raised beds or Pro-trays with cocopeat. Treat seeds with Trichoderma viride (4g/kg).
    *   **Tip**: Cover nursery with 40-mesh nylon net to prevent virus vectors (Whitefly).
*   **Recommended Products** (Select these in Relationship field):
    *   *Humic Acid* (for root initiation)
    *   *Sticker/Spreader*

### Stage 2: Transplanting & Establishment
*   **Stage Name**: `Transplanting Phase (25-45 Days)`
*   **Description**:
    *   **Goal**: Transplant shock recovery and root establishment.
    *   **Action**: Drench seedlings with fungicide before transplanting. Maintain spacing of 60x45 cm.
    *   **Nutrition**: Apply basal dose of FYM. Start fertigation on Day 5.
*   **Recommended Products**:
    *   *NPK 19:19:19* (Vegetative balance)
    *   *Root Promoter* (Mycorrhiza)
    *   *Micronutrient Mixture*

### Stage 3: Vegetative Growth
*   **Stage Name**: `Vegetative Growth (45-65 Days)`
*   **Description**:
    *   **Goal**: Strong branching and canopy development.
    *   **Action**: Pinch off side shoots (suckers) in indeterminate varieties. Staking/trellising is crucial now.
    *   **Pest Watch**: Monitor for Leaf Miner and Sucking pests.
*   **Recommended Products**:
    *   *NPK 12:61:00* (Phosphorus for branching)
    *   *Seaweed Extract* (Stress tolerance)
    *   *Neem Oil* (Preventive pest control)

### Stage 4: Flowering & Fruit Setting
*   **Stage Name**: `Flowering & Fruit Set (65-85 Days)`
*   **Description**:
    *   **Goal**: Maximize flower retention and pollination.
    *   **Action**: Avoid heavy nitrogen now (causes vegetative growth instead of fruit).
    *   **Critical Nutrient**: Calcium and Boron are vital to prevent Blossom End Rot.
*   **Recommended Products**:
    *   *NPK 0:52:34* (MKP for flowering)
    *   *Chelated Calcium*
    *   *Boron 20%* (Flower holding)
    *   *Amino Acid* (Bio-stimulant)

### Stage 5: Fruit Development
*   **Stage Name**: `Fruit Development (85-110 Days)`
*   **Description**:
    *   **Goal**: Fruit sizing, weight, and shine.
    *   **Action**: Maintain consistent soil moisture to prevent fruit cracking.
    *   **Nutrition**: High Potassium requirement.
*   **Recommended Products**:
    *   *NPK 13:0:45* (Potassium Nitrate)
    *   *NPK 0:0:50* (SOP for weight/sugar)
    *   *Calcium Nitrate* (Firmness)

### Stage 6: Harvesting
*   **Stage Name**: `Harvesting (110+ Days)`
*   **Description**:
    *   **Goal**: Prolonged harvest and keeping quality.
    *   **Action**: Harvest at 'Breaker' stage for distant markets.
    *   **Post-Harvest**: Apply fungicide if rain occurs during harvest.
*   **Recommended Products**:
    *   *NPK 0:0:50* (Continue for later flushes)
    *   *Sticker* (to prolong leaf life)
